# Cloud

For this part I used GCP, as we saw in the course, a VM instance was used, which we configured to install MAGE and carry out all the orchestration and pipeline creation processes, it will be explained in more detail in the ingestion module.

For the storage part, Cloud Storage Bucket was used and BigQuery was used for the model of the created tables.

With this we can attach the images of how they look using these cloud tools.
