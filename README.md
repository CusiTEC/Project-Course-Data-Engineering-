# Course Project - Data Engineering Zoomcamp
## By Edgar Raul Cusi Osccorima

This project was carried out thanks to the Data Engineering zoomcamp taught by DataTalksClub, in each part of this project I demonstrate each of the skills that I managed to develop to start my career as a Data Engineer.

The following project is an example of a practical case with data used from Kaggle, first it will show the diagram of the project and finally the order of it so that it can be carefully reviewed and replicated.
